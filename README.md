# Exemplar-Based Image Inpainting (Criminisi et al. 2004)

This group project is a Python implementation of the **exemplar-based inpainting algorithm** introduced by Criminisi, P√©rez, and Toyama (2004) as part of a final assignment for IMA201-Introduction to image Preprocessing course at Telecom Paris in october 2023.

The method fills missing regions in images by iteratively copying the most similar patches from known areas, combining **texture synthesis** with **structure propagation** to achieve realistic results.

## üìå Features

- Implementation of the Criminisi et al. algorithm from scratch in Python  
- Patch extraction and matching using Sum of Squared Differences (SSD)  
- Confidence term and data term priority function  
- Iterative filling of missing regions guided by boundary pixels  
- Demonstration on custom masks (object removal / hole filling)
